# 3D_air_written_digit_recognition_groupwork
●	Designed and implemented an advanced learning system that utilizes 3-D location time series data from a LeapMotion sensor to recognize hand-written digits with remarkable accuracy.

●	Skillfully collected and processed complex data from an experiment, leveraging a matleap Leap Motion Controller Interface to record index finger location data.

●	Successfully achieved the project objective of accurately classifying digits 0 to 9 based on the data obtained from the LeapMotion sensor, delivering a significant contribution to the field of ML.
